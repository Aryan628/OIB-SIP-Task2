# BMI Calculator

This is a simple Python script for calculating Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for weight and height. It also classifies the BMI into different categories (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese) and displays the result. The script provides an option to continue calculating BMI for additional inputs until the user decides to exit.

## Usage

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter the requested weight and height when prompted.
3. View the calculated BMI and its corresponding category.
4. Choose whether to continue or exit after each calculation.
